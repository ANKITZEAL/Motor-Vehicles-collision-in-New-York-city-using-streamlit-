# Motor-Vehicles-collision-in-New-York-city-using-streamlit


## Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python
Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. With Streamlit, no callbacks are needed since widgets are treated as variables. Data caching simplifies and speeds up computation pipelines. Streamlit watches for changes on updates of the linked Git repository and the application will be deployed automatically in the shared link.

## Projects Description
This Project is Related to Motor Vehicles collision in New York city üöóüí•üöô
In this Project we will try to find out solutions of certain question asked and try to convert these questions into app.
1. Where are the Most people Injured ?
2. How many collisions Occur during given day of time ?
3. Top 5 dangerous streets ?
